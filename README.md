A more in depth brekadown for all notes can be found in the folder under the Capstone_Notes.txt

1. Ask Phase
To analyse "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently?" so that casual members can be converted to annual members

2. Prepare Phase
The information downloaded and used comes directly from Divvy Bikes website at https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
It is for one years worth of data organised by month (April 2020 - April 2021)
It is assumed to be credible and coming directly from the organisation

3.Process Phase
After importing the data and doing a quick check through and formatting of each document
we added two columns "day_of_week" (as a number value) and "ride_length" (in seconds)
Any data that had unusual values or information that seemed impossible (negative ride length times) was excluded

4. Analyse Phase
Rstudio was used to look into trends and patterns in the data as well as create new columns and better create starting dates to look into trends by day of the week. More in depth notes can be found in the text file located in the folder

5.Share Phase
Visualisations were created in Tableau and Rstudio the Tabelau link can be found below:

6. Act Phase
The powerpoint presentaiton with the findings and recommendations can be found in the folder above as Cyclistic_Stakeholder_Presentation.pptx
